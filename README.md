# My Codewars Python Solutions 🐍💡

Welcome to my collection of Python solutions for various Codewars katas! This repository serves as a personal log of my journey to improve problem-solving skills, explore different algorithms, and practice writing clean, efficient Python code.



## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing and showcasing my solutions to programming challenges found on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Each kata (programming challenge) is organized into its own directory, typically containing:

* `solution.py`: My Python implementation for the kata.
* `tests.py`: Local test cases (often adapted from Codewars or custom-made) to verify the solution's correctness.

The goal is to continuously learn, refactor, and apply best practices in software development.



## 📂 Kata Structure

Here's a glimpse of how the solutions are organized within the `katas/` directory:

```

.
├── katas/
│   ├── duplicate_encode/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── tests.py
│   ├── nth_occurrences/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── tests.py
│   ├── pangram/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── tests.py
│   ├── reject/
│   │   ├── main.py  # or solution.py
│   │   └── test_reject.py # or tests.py
│   ├── squares/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── tests.py
│   └── to_jaden_case/
│       ├── solution.py
│       └── tests.py
└── .gitignore
└── Dockerfile
└── .github/
└── workflows/

````



## ✅ How to Run Tests Locally

To run the tests for a specific kata, navigate into its directory and execute the `tests.py` file using Python.

**Example (for `duplicate_encode`):**

```bash
cd katas/duplicate_encode
python -m unittest tests.py
````

This will run the test suite for that particular kata, helping you verify the correctness of the solution.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Python 3**: The primary programming language for all solutions.
  * **`CODEWARS unit test`**: Python's built-in testing framework used for verifying solutions.
