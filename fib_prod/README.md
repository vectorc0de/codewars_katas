You are given a positive integer n greater than one.

How many ways are there to represent it as a product of some Fibonacci numbers greater than one?

(Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...).

For example, there are two ways for n = 40:

    2 * 2 * 2 * 5
    5 * 8

But you can't represent n = 7 in an aforementioned way.

Note that n may be really big (up to 10^36). Good luck!
